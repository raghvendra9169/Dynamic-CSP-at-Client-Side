## Demonstration of Browser working

This page explains how to run this browser, how it works, and how it generates CSP for the website.


## Prerequisite

To start the demonstration, the necessary packeges/framework (like PyQt5, PyQtWebEngine) can be installed by executing [reqturements.txt](https://github.com/brcnitk/PG-23-24-Raghavendra/edit/main/Major%20Project/browser/requirements.txt) using the following command.


```
pip install requirements.txt
```

### Structure of the Browser directory

This browser is build using [PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/). This modular browser file structure is given below:  

```bash
└── Browser
      ├── main.py
      ├── main_window.py
      ├── tab.py
      ├── url_bar.py
      ├── history.py
      ├── csp.py
      ├── images
            └── back.png
            ├── forward.png
                  ......
```


 - main.py:  Initializes the application and displays the main window.   
 - main_window.py: Manages the main window, tab widget, toolbar, history, bookmarks, and cookies management.   
 - tab.py: Creates individual browser tabs with web views and URL bars, and handles URL navigation and history recording.  
 - toolbar.py: Defines the toolbar with actions for navigation, new tabs, history, bookmarks, cookies management  
 - url_bar.py: Implements the URL bar for entering and navigating to web addresses.  
 - history.py: Manages and displays the browsing history.    
 - csp.py: Generates and enforce Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to improve web page security.

And an [image folder](https://github.com/brcnitk/PG-23-24-Raghavendra/edit/main/Major%20Project/browser/images), which contains all the required images.

### steps to run the source code

- Install all python packages which is mention in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/brcnitk/PG-23-24-Raghavendra/edit/main/Major%20Project/browser/requirements.txt)

```
git clone https://github.com/brcnitk/PG-23-24-Raghavendra/tree/main/Major%20Project/browser
cd browser
python3 main.py
```
 
- After running above cammond, you will see [image below](https://github.com/brcnitk/PG-23-24-Raghavendra/blob/main/Major%20Project/images/module_brow.png) as an output.

- Search any website, and the generated CSP will be displayed on the terminal. For example, I have hosted a website named  https://inorawancareers.com/. The CSP generated by the browser for this website is shown in the [below image.](https://github.com/brcnitk/PG-23-24-Raghavendra/blob/main/Major%20Project/images/multiple_csp.png)
